# Rudy

Rudy is a rudimentary configuration management tool. It can be used to to 
configure a few servers for production service of a simple PHP web 
application or some other, not very challenging, task
 
Features:

* Rudy provides an abstraction that allows specifying a file's content and 
metadata (owner, group, mode).

* It provides an abstraction that allows installing and removing Debian 
packages.

* Provides a mechanism for restarting a service when relevant files or 
packages are updated.

* Rudy is idempotent.

* It is documented (including installation and use).


Please use the examples above and read its *man page*
